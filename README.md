This HTML and JavaScript code creates a simple weather information webpage. Users can select a city from the dropdown menu, and upon clicking the "Submit" button, the webpage displays the selected city's name, current temperature, and an icon representing the weather condition.

The JavaScript code listens for the click event on the "Submit" button. When clicked, it retrieves the selected city value from the dropdown menu and iterates through the list of cities to find a match. Once a match is found, it dynamically creates HTML elements to display the city name, temperature, and weather icon within a container div. The container is then appended to the main container on the webpage.

The weather information is stored in an array of objects named cities, where each object represents a city and includes properties such as name, temperature, and weather icon URL.

The HTML structure includes a header with the title "Weather Information," a dropdown menu to select the city, and a main container to display the weather information dynamically. The CSS styling can be added to customize the appearance of the webpage further.
